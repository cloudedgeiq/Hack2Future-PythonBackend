### Problem Statement
Solve the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 8x + 15 = 0
\]

### Step 1: Identify the coefficients
For the quadratic equation in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), we identify the coefficients:

- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = -8 \)
- \( c = 15 \)

### Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula
The solutions for \( x \) can be found using the quadratic formula:

\[
x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

### Step 3: Substitute the values into the formula
Substituting the identified coefficients into the formula:

\[
x_{1,2} = \frac{-(-8) \pm \sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(1)(15)}}{2(1)}
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the expression
Calculating the components step-by-step:

1. Calculate \( -(-8) \):
   \[
   -(-8) = 8
   \]

2. Calculate \( (-8)^2 \):
   \[
   (-8)^2 = 64
   \]

3. Calculate \( 4ac \):
   \[
   4(1)(15) = 60
   \]

4. Substitute these values back into the equation:
   \[
   x_{1,2} = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{64 - 60}}{2}
   \]

5. Simplify under the square root:
   \[
   64 - 60 = 4
   \]

6. Thus, we have:
   \[
   x_{1,2} = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{4}}{2}
   \]

7. Calculate \( \sqrt{4} \):
   \[
   \sqrt{4} = 2
   \]

### Step 5: Final calculations for \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \)
Now we can find the two solutions:

1. For \( x_1 \):
   \[
   x_1 = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
   \]

2. For \( x_2 \):
   \[
   x_2 = \frac{8 - 2}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]

### Final Answer
The solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 8x + 15 = 0 \) are:

\[
x_1 = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad x_2 = 3
\]
