Here is the corrected and enhanced transcription based on the provided image:

```
X² - 8X + 15 = 0
a = 1   b = -8   c = 15
x₁,₂ = -b ± √(b² - 4ac)
       2a
       = -(-8) ± √((-8)² - 4(1)(15))
       2(1)
       = 8 ± √(64 - 60)
       2
       = 8 ± √4
       2
       = 8 ± 2
       2
x₁ = 8 + 2
       2
   = 10
       2
   = 5
x₂ = 8 - 2
       2
   = 6
       2
   = 3
```

Corrections made:
- The transcription of the equation and variables was accurate, but the formatting of the division lines and the placement of the numbers was adjusted for clarity.
- The expression for \( x₁,₂ \) was corrected to ensure proper formatting of the fraction and square root.
- The division lines were clarified to indicate the division operation more clearly.
- The final results for \( x₁ \) and \( x₂ \) were formatted to reflect the division clearly. 

Overall, the structure was preserved while ensuring accuracy in the mathematical expressions.
