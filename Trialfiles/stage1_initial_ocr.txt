Here is the extracted handwritten text and mathematical expressions from the image:

```
X² - 8X + 15 = 0
a = 1   b = -8   c = 15
x₁,₂ = -b ± √(b² - 4ac)
       2a
       = -(-8) ± √((-8)² - 4(1)(15))
       2(1)
       = 8 ± √(64 - 60)
       2
       = 8 ± √4
       2
       = 8 ± 2
       2
x₁ = 8 + 2
       2
   = 10
       2
   = 5
x₂ = 8 - 2
       2
   = 6
       2
   = 3
